# DinoRide

## 💡 Inspiration
We wanted to reimagine a modern app in a prehistoric context. We thought a taxi service but with dinosaurs would have been funny, and somewhat useful to cavepeople.

## 📱 What it does
DinoRide allows you to book a trip and have dinosaurs deliver you to your desired location!

## 🛠 How we built it
 - **Adobe XD**: We used Adobe XD to build the mockups for our mobile app. We wireframed the entire application and used tested a lot of fonts as well in Adobe XD.
 - **Flutter**: Our mobile app is made using Flutter which means that our mobile app is cross-platform. Flutter made making the mobile app easy and quick.
 - **Open Street Maps**: DinoRide uses Open Street Maps to determine the user's location and renders out an interactive, custom map in a prehistoric theme.

## 🛑 Challenges we ran into
- Figuring out coordinate math
- Parsing the real-life map data into a prehistoric visualization
- Finding good assets for the map
- Making sure the dinosaurs actually stayed on the roads

## ✅ Accomplishments that we're proud of
 - Being able to completely change the look of Google Maps
 - Adding some basic loading animations

## 📖 What we learned
- Using Open Street Maps API and data
- Paint to the screen in Flutter

## 🤔 What's next for DinoRide
- Improve the visuals, add a user account system
- Implement a rating system for individual dinosaurs
- Add appropriate dinosaurs by location to improve believability
